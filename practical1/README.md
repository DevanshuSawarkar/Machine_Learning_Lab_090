### 📌 Part A: Simple Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Predict *writing score* based on *reading score*
- **Procedure**:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Feature selection
  - Train-test split
  - Model training using `LinearRegression`
  - Prediction and evaluation using:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - R² Score
  - Plotting regression line for visualization

### 📌 Part B: Multiple Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Predict *math score* based on *reading score*, and *writing score*
- **Procedure**:
  - Train-test split
  - Model training and prediction
  - Evaluation of model performance
